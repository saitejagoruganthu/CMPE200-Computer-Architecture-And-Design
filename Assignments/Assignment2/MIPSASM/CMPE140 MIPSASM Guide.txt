installation:
1. Run the mipsasm20_install.exe.

2. Choose your installation folder, for example "D:\MIPSASM". Start installation.

3. If any options pop up during installation, click yes.

4. Copy the mipsasm215.exe and paste it in your installation folder. 


Use:
Note: The MIPSASM is quite an outdated simulator so it needs some extra care.

1. Run mipsasm215.exe. Do not use mipsasm.exe (it gives you wrong results).

2. Open file might not work so just copy and paste your code (e.g., mipstest.asm) into the editor.

3. Select MIPS - Assembly or click the assembly label directly to assemble your code. If the machine code does not show up, do this again.

4. Execute or single step through the code in the Machine Code window. Select View - Registers / Memory if it does not show up. Observe its content to finish your assignment.



For any questions, ask me via Email/Canvas/Slack or during office hours. Good luck on your assignments!
